# Dependents Assistant
This is the final project of my Engineer's degree (Industrial Electronics and Automatic Engineering). You can read the full [thesis](TFG_LuisCamberoPiqueras_100345851.pdf) (spanish) or review the code that I've done for the prototype. in the following section you can find a summary.


## Abstract
In the present Final Degree Project, a system has been developed for the
control and assistance to dependents, whose main objective is to be able to provide
non-urgent remote assistance automatically, based on data
collected from the patient environment. In this way, it is intended that people in
the situation of dependency, which are the ones that usually require the most assistance, have
an extra tool that is capable of requesting assistance, even if the person cannot.
Dependent people often need another person or system that
control and help them in daily tasks, therefore, the automation of these
controls and requests for assistance allows us to reduce costs while doing
more accurate and smarter way. 

Current automation in this field is not very
advanced. Currently, telecare services depend on the press of a
button by the user to realize the need for care. In the cases of
those who, for whatever reason, the user cannot use the said button, the assistance
it may take too long. In this work, a conversational interface has been used as a substitute for this button, so that the user requests assistance
just with the use of your voice. Trying to cover the cases in which the person could not
make use of your voice, the system incorporates a series of sensors to obtain
data from which an anomalous pattern can be extracted corresponding to a situation
that requires assistance.

To carry out the work, a previous study has been carried out on the
concept of the person in a situation of dependency and the needs that these
people have. In addition, a review of the technologies used is included, as well as
of its evolution and the justification of its choice, also showing other similar or
alternatives. The emphasis is on conversational interfaces as they are differentiating part
of the system developed by allowing the user a more natural interaction
and free of dependencies on any other external device. 

Other technologies, such as
machine learning algorithms, which allow the recognition of
patterns also play a very important role, since it allows detecting situations
of possible danger or alert without the supervision of a technician. For the detection of these
patterns, data is collected from different environmental variables using sensors, which
are constantly transmitting their data over the Internet.

The document incorporates an overview
of the different parts of the system, and a detailed description, which explains
the work done in a technical way. In addition, project management,
the regulatory framework, and the impact on the socio-economic environment has been incorporated. It also includes the
evaluation carried out, which together with the initial objectives, have been used to extract the
conclusions once the present Final Degree Project is finished.
